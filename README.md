# Social-Network-Ads
This notebook focuses on predicting whether a customer will make a purchase based on their Age and Estimated Salary.
It utilizes K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification for prediction.
Summary of Steps
Loaded the dataset (Social Network Ads).

Checked for missing values and dataset structure.

Selected relevant features (Age & Estimated Salary).

Standardized the features for better KNN performance.

Split data into training (75%) and testing (25%).

Trained a KNN classifier with 5 neighbors.

Made predictions and evaluated the model accuracy.

Final Thoughts
This project uses KNN classification to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on Age and Estimated Salary. Feature scaling is essential in KNN, as distance-based models perform better with normalized data.
